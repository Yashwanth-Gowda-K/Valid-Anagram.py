# Valid-Anagram.py


The Anagram Detection Project is a Python-based solution designed to check whether two given strings are anagrams of each other. The program efficiently compares the strings by counting the frequency of characters in each and then determining if they match. This solution uses hash maps (dictionaries) for optimal performance, ensuring an O(n) time complexity, which makes it scalable even for larger datasets.

Features
Efficient Anagram Detection: The solution uses a dictionary (hash map) to count and compare characters in two strings, ensuring an optimal and scalable solution.

O(n) Time Complexity: The program operates in linear time relative to the length of the strings, making it fast and efficient.

Clean and Modular Code: The project is written in a clean and modular way to make it easy for developers to understand and extend.
